## How to work with this material

This material serves as a follow-up to a training course on the subject of electronic lab notebooks. However, it can also be used as a self-learning material. 

!!! example "Exercise 0.1: Short introduction"

	This highlights exercises that were included in the training course. If you are using this GitBook as self-learning material, you can think about these questions for yourself and work through the exercises.

## Content of this Learning material

This course will start with a short **introduction into the basic principles of research data management** ([01 Introduction to Research Data Management](../01%20Introduction%20to%20Research%20Data%20Management/1_RDM.md)).

Then we will dive into the topic of **Electronic Lab Notebooks**. We start with an **introduction** ([2.1 Introduction to Electronic Lab Notebooks](../02%20Electronic%20Lab%20Notebooks/2.1_Introduction_Electronic_Lab_Notebooks.md)), where you will learn what are the advantages of ELNs and how to choose an ELN that fits your needs ([2.2 Selection of Electronic Lab Notebooks](../02%20Electronic%20Lab%20Notebooks/2.2_Selection_Electronic_Lab_Notebooks.md)). Afterwards we will have a look at two Electronic Lab Notebooks that were developed at KIT: **Chemotion** ([2.3 Example: Chemotion](../02%20Electronic%20Lab%20Notebooks/2.3_Chemotion.md)) and **Kadi4Mat** ([2.4 Example: Kadi4Mat](../02%20Electronic%20Lab%20Notebooks/2.4_Kadi4Mat.md)).

At the end we will conclude the results ([03 Conclusion](../03%20Conclusion/3_Conclusion.md)).

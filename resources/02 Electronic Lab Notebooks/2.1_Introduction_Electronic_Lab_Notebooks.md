# 2.1 Introduction to Electronic Lab Notebooks

>The content in this section is adapted from [RDM@KIT](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/researchdata_rdm_eln.php).

**For planning, conducting and analyzing research experiments, electronic laboratory notebooks are becoming more and more common, thus contributing to the digitization of research.**

Laboratory notebooks play an important role in the **planning, conducting and analysis of (natural) scientific experiments**. Lab books are traditionally analogue and paper-based, an approach that is no longer up-to-date, as research data is primarily available in digital form. The solution are **electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs)**. These offer significant [advantages](https://www.publisso.de/en/research-data-management/rd-documenting/benefits-of-an-eln). They can be linked directly to laboratory devices, analysis software or storage systems, making results more reproducible and research more efficient.

There is now a whole range of ELNs adapted to the **various needs of different scientific disciplines**. Two of them are [Chemotion ELN](https://chemotion.net/) and [Kadi4Mat](https://kadi.iam.kit.edu/), both are developed at KIT. More information on these two ELNs can be found at the section "[Services & Tools](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/servicestools.php)".

For assistance on selecting and implementing an ELN, please refer to the [ELN Guide](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006425772) and the [ELN Finder](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/home).

## Introduction to Electronic Lab Notebooks

### What is a laboratory notebook?

- Laboratory notebooks are used to document, conduct and analyze scientific experiments and research data generated during the process
- They are primarily used in natural sciences
- Using them is part of „[Good research practise](../01%20Introduction%20to%20Research%20Data%20Management/1_RDM.md/#good-research-practice)“: “Continuous quality assurance during the research process includes (…) the keeping of laboratory notebooks.“[^1][^2] (DE: [^3][^4])

**How does it look like:**

- Notebook, no loose sheets of paper
- Table of content
- Numbering of pages
- Records by days
- Experimental planning and conducting
- Recording results and measured data

**Important:**

- Permanent ink
- Should be written during or directly following an experiment
- Stays in the lab or institute

!!! success "Summary: What is a laboratory notebook?"

	A laboratory notebook is a **legal document to prove your scientific work** and serves as a **defense against accusations of misconduct**.

#### Disadvantages of lab notebooks

- Experiments and results must be recorded manually
- Tables, graphs and analysis are available in digital form, but must be in the lab notebook, so they are often printed out and pasted in
- Is it readable and understandable for everyone?
- You can't access your lab notebook yourself, because it is in the institute

#### Famous negative example: Marie Curie‘s laboratory notebook

- After more than 100 years, many of Marie Curie's personal items, including her laboratory notes, are still radioactive[^5][^6]
- Curie's laboratory notes, are stored in lead-lined boxes at the French Bibliotheque National in Paris.
- Radioactive half life of Radium t<sub>½</sub>(<sup>226</sup>Ra) ≈ 1602 a

### The solution: Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELNs)

>The content in this section is adapted from [ELN Finder](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/info/page/faq)

An electronic lab notebook (ELN) is a specialized software for:

- the **structured description of an experiment**, i.e. keeping records of
    - the procedure
    - the used materials and instruments
    - the observations made during the experiment (incl. photos)
    - the metadata/description of the data generated in the experiment and, if applicable, the files (or links to them) and inferences related to it
- the **long term preservation and access** of all this information in compliance with **long-term archival criteria**

!!! success "Summary: What is an electronic laboratory notebook?"

	This means: An ELN is more than just a digital copy of a paper-based lab notebook. In fact, they can be **fully implemented into the digital research data management system**.

#### Advantages of ELNs

>The following content is adapted from [ZB MED](https://www.publisso.de/en/research-data-management/rd-documenting/benefits-of-an-eln) and the [ZB MED ELN-Guide](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006425772).

**Linked digital research environment**

- Automatisation: Measuring devices deliver their data directly to the ELN
- External and internal linking to files and data sets
- Integration or linking of data that is already available in a digital format (e.g. measurements, images, tables)
- API for integration into the existing software environment
- Interfaces to other programs (e.g. ChemDraw)
- Import and export function
- Direct connection to research data repositories, data services or publication platforms
- Assign metadata
- Ability to assign persistent identifiers

**Collaboration with others**

- Sharing of research data, process protocols, workflows, templates
- Rights and role management
- Ability to comment/write messages directly in the ELN
- Define tasks

**Standardization**

- Create, reuse and share templates for protocols, processes and workflows

**Evidentiary value**

- Versioning
- Audit trail
- Electronic signature and time stamp

**And much more**

- Search functions and filtering options
- Option to use tags
- Access to the lab notebook at any time from anywhere
- Structuring and visualization of processes and workflows
- Easy to create backups
- Managing inventories 
- Tracking equipment and equipment maintenance schedules
- Possibility to use tablets
- …

!!! success "Summary: What are advantages of ELNs?"

	- Boost efficiency of everyday tasks
	- Higher efficiency in daily work
	- Saves time and increases data quality
	- Avoids information loss
	- Make research findings traceable and verifiable
	- Provide a means of preparing research data for publication and digital preservation
	- Connected digital research environment
	


#### What is the difference between ELN and LIMS?

- **Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN):** Used to plan experiments, record data, offer features that cover project, inventory, and laboratory management processes, more often used in research context as it is more flexible[^7]
- **Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS):** Especially used in routine laboratories (e.g. diagnostic laboratories), sample-centred[^7]
- Please note that ELN and LIMS can be connected, if both support this integration.
- More information on LIMS can be found on [lims.de](https://www.lims.de/en/)

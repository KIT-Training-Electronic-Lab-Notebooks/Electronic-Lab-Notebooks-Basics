# 2.3 Example: Chemotion

>The content in this section is adapted from [RDM@KIT](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/servicestools_tools_chemotion.php).

[Chemotion](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/home/welcome) offers a free-to-use infrastructure and open source software for the management of research data, especially for chemists and related sciences. Chemotion includes a suite consisting of an [electronic laboratory notebook](https://www.rdm.kit.edu/english/researchdata_rdm_eln.php) ([Chemotion ELN](https://www.chemotion.net/)), a [web repository](https://doi.org/10.17616/R34P5T) and helpful tools. The goal is to simplify routine work with molecular data, thus increasing the amount of open data and improving the quality of the information obtained and published.  
The software is increasingly being extended to related fields and further developed into a generic ELN (“[LabIMotion](https://chemotion.net/docs/labimotion)”). You can find more information about Chemotion on the [website](https://www.chemotion.net/), as well as via [NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/setup-own-eln/), which regularly holds events such as [Q&As and hands-on workshops](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/events/), and via the [Chemotion ELN YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@chemotioneln9781?cbrd=1&ucbcb=1).

#### Hands-on Chemotion ELN
- Go to the [Demo version](https://demo.chemotion.ibcs.kit.edu/home) of Chemotion ELN
- Click on `Sign up` to create an account for the Demo version
- **Create a collection** with your favorite name (e.g. 'My Lab Notebook')

![Chemotion - How to create a collection](attachments/Hands-on_Chemotion_01.png)

- **Add a sample** by using the molecule structure editor Ketcher
	- Click on your new collection and then on the blue arrow near the `+` and `Create sample`
	- Then click in the Editor field
	- Scetch your desired chemical structure
	- Do not forget to save your sample! Therefore click on the blue `Save`-Button, and then on the yellow `Save sample`-Button

![](attachments/Hands-on_Chemotion_04.png)

- **Add additonal information** on your molecule
	- Click on your molecule and on `CaL-1`
	- Then add additional information like `Amount`, `Density`, `Molarity`, `Concentration`, `Solvents` `Boiling point` and so on.
	- Note: Adding the `Density` or the `Molarity` is essential. Automatic calculation of the mass (by volume)
	- Further down you can find the automatically generated SMILES and InChI codes
	- In the `Analysis`-Section you can add Analysis like NMR data
	- You can also add Literature by the DOI in the `Literature`-Section
	- For more information click [here](https://www.chemotion.net/docs/eln/ui/details_modal).

![](attachments/Hands-on_Chemotion_05.png)

You can also add reactions and analysis and much more. When you want to publish your data you can do this directly in the [Chemotion Repository](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome).

## Selection of Electronic Lab Notebooks: How do I decide which ELN fits me?

There are now a large number of ELNs on the market. They cover different requirements, some are generic, others are discipline-specific. Accordingly, the choice of the appropriate ELN is up to the user. To find out which ELN is best suited to you and your research, and how to implement one in your laboratory, we recommend the ELN Finder and the ELN Guide.

„There is no “one-size-fits-all” answer to the question of whether to develop a solution in-house or opt for an open-source or commercial product.“[^1]

More and more laboratories are replacing their paper lab notebooks with electronic laboratory notebooks, or ELNs.
But this transition is about **more than just replacing paper with digital alternatives**. It’s also about finding ways to integrate electronic lab notebooks into an overarching digital research data management (RDM) system.

The [ELN-Guide](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006425772) provides:

- Requirements for an Electronic Lab Notebook
- Procedure for the introduction of an ELN
- Best-Practice-Examples
- Toolboxes for needs assessment

### ELN Finder

>The content in this section is adapted from [ELN Finder](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/home).

The [ELN Finder](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/home) helps you to search and select a suitable Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) for your purposes. The ELN Finder uses the [following metadata schema](https://doi.org/10.4126/FRL01-006452815).

##### Hands on: ELN Finder

1. Go to the website: [https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/home](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/home)
2. Click on „`Find ELNs`“
3. Search for an ELN that fits your needs using the filter criteria, e.g. `License` or `Subject` .

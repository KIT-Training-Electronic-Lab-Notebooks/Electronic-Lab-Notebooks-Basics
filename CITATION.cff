title: Electronic Lab Notebooks - Support from data acquisition to publication
abstract: >-
  Laboratory notebooks play an important role in planning, conducting and
  analysing scientific experiments. Due to digitalisation, electronic versions
  of the classic laboratory notebooks are becoming more and more common. These
  Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) have the advantage that they can be connected
  directly to measuring devices, analysis programs or storage systems, making
  results easier to understand and research more efficient. In this module you
  will learn the basics of ELNs, we will support you in selecting the right ELN
  for your research. Two ELNs (Chemotion and Kadi4Mat) are presented for
  self-testing.
